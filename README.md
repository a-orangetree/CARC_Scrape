##INTRODUCTION
This program scrapes relevant CARC/RARC codelist information from the Washington Publishing Company (WPC) and outputs an Excel file
which can be merged into another file or imported into a database. These codelists are viewable free online. Viewing the lists 
online, however is often inconvenient and must be manually copied into another medium (e.g. Excel) to be useful.

##CARCs
CARC stands for "Claim Adjustment Reason Code." From the WPC website:

Claim adjustment reason codes communicate an adjustment, meaning that they must communicate why a claim or service line was 
paid differently than it was billed. If there is no adjustment to a claim/line, then there is no adjustment reason code.


##RARCs
RARC stands for "Remittance Advice Remark Code." From the WPC website:

Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs) are used to provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a 
Claim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) or to convey information about remittance processing. Each RARC identifies a specific message 
as shown in the Remittance Advice Remark Code List. There are two types of RARCs, supplemental and informational. The majority of 
the RARCs are supplemental; these are generally referred to as RARCs without further distinction. Supplemental RARCs provide 
additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a CARC. The second type of RARC is informational; these RARCs are 
all prefaced with Alert: and are often referred to as Alerts. Alerts are used to convey information about remittance processing 
and are never related to a specific adjustment or CARC.
